# Douha Kachachi — CV / Portfolio Starter

This is a minimal, responsive single-page CV/portfolio starter.

Files added:

- `index.html` — single-page content with your sections (About, Skills, Experience, Education, Projects, Contact).
- `styles.css` — basic responsive styles.
- `assets/` — place your `photo.jpg` and `douha_kachachi_cv.pdf` here.

How to preview

Open `index.html` in your browser, or run a simple HTTP server from this folder:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Replace the placeholder files in `assets/` with your real photo and CV PDF, and update any links in `index.html`.

If you want, I can now:

- Tweak the visual style (colors, fonts).
- Add a downloadable PDF link that opens in a new tab.
- Scaffold a small build (live reload) or add meta tags for SEO.
